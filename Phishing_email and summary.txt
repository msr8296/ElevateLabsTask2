Attachment: Verify_Details.docx


- The sender's email looks like PayPal but the domain is paypa1.com, (the l is replaced with 1). This is fake.
- The email asks you to click a link that is not on the real PayPal website.
- It uses urgent language ("24 hours", "account closure") to scare you into acting fast.
- There's an attachment (Verify_Details.docx) which could contain malware.
- The greeting is generic ("Dear Customer") instead of using your name.
- The email likely fails email security checks (SPF/DKIM/DMARC) and may be sent from an unauthorized server.

What to do 
1. Do NOT click the link or open the attachment.
2. Do not reply to the email.
3. Check your account by typing the official website address (paypal.com) into your browser or using the official app.
4. Forward the email to PayPal's official phishing report address (e.g., spoof@paypal.com) if you use PayPal.
5. Delete the email after reporting it.
